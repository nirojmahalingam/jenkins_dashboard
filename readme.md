## Jenkins Dashboard for Builds
Jenkins Dashboard for Builds.
Dashboard is based on Laravel 5, because we like it. For the template we did use Ultimo Admin because of laziness and its based on Bootstrap.

To Run this Application install PHP 5.6 on your System.

### Installation
Modify the following Config File /config/app.php Line 6. Add your Jenkins URL.
To use Jenkins Rest API, please let the User "Anonym" read the general, job and view information.
